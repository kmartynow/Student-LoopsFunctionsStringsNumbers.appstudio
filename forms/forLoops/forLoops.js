/*
Loops are great if you want to do the same thing more than once such as  
walk through items in an array and print them. 

1. DO TOGETHER
Use a for loop that outputs the numbers between 0 and 5, one per line  
to the console.
*/


/* ***********************************
2. CLASS ACTIVITY
Output the even numbers between 1 and 10 to the console, one per line. 
Use a for loop and an if statement.
Hint: Mod operator (%): returns remainder of a division (vs quotient). 
eg. 10 % 2 = 0  Explanation: 10/2 has no remainder so the 'mod' answer is 0.
*/

/*
3. DO TOGETHER
Use a for loop to output each item in the 'nums' array below to the console, 
one per line. ** Pretend you don't know ahead of time how many 
items are in the array.  
*/

/* ***********************************
4. CLASS ACTIVITY
Copy the code from the 'nums' example above and paste it below.
Change the code so it SUMS UP the numbers in the nums array and 
outputs the sum to the console after the loop completes. 
Note: Answer should be 5005.
